# STAT231: Tutorial Code (for Winter 2021)
In this repository I am including some of the R code, for the tutorials [available here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_xQeFdhjymQzmW4WKYtlpQ).

Some of the tutorial code may have been missed, and if there is anything further that you would like to see, please let me know and I will try to provide it!
